      <p id="tribute-info" class="center">Edgar Schmued was instrumental to the development 
      of mid-20th century military aircraft. From propeller-based airplanes to jet fighters, Schmued designed several war planes
      used in World War II and the Korean War. These designs were used in many theatres of war and remain popular in U.S. military and aviation circles.
